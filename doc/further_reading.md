1. [CODING for the MIT-IBM 704 COMPUTER, October 1957](http://bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/computer_center/Coding_for_the_MIT-IBM_704_Computer_Oct57.pdf)
    This paper is not about Lisp. But it is about the particular individual computer on which Lisp was first implemented, and it is written in part by members of the Lisp team. I have found it useful in understanding the software environment in which, and the constraints under which, Lisp was written.
2. [MIT AI Memo 1, John McCarthy, September 1958](https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/MIT/AIM-001.pdf)
    This is, as far as I can find, the earliest specification document of the Lisp project.
3. [Lisp 1 Programmer's Manual, Phyllis Fox, March 1960](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/rle_lisp/LISP_I_Programmers_Manual_Mar60.pdf)
4. [Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual, Michael I. Levin, August 1962](https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf#page=81)
    This book is essential reading: it documents in some detail the first fully realised Lisp language system.

    This is mainly about why to use Lisp as a language for modern commercial software, but has useful insights into where it comes from.
    > So the short explanation of why this 1950s language is not obsolete is that it was not technology but math, and math doesn't get stale.
