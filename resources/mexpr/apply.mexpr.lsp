;; see page 70 of Lisp 1.5 Programmers Manual; this expands somewhat 
;; on the accounts of eval and apply given on page 13. This is M-expr
;; syntax, obviously. 

;; ## APPLY

;; NOTE THAT I suspect there is a typo in the printed manual in line
;; 7 of this definition, namely a missing closing square bracket before
;; the final semi-colon; that has been corrected here. 

;; RIGHT! So the 'EXPR' representation of a function is expected to be
;; on the `EXPR` property on the property list of the symbol which is 
;; its name; an expression is simply a Lisp S-Expression as a structure
;; of cons cells and atoms in memory. The 'SUBR' representation, expected
;; to be on the `SUBR` property, is literally a subroutine written in 
;; assembly code, so what is happening in the curly braces is putting the
;; arguments into processor registers prior to a jump to subroutine - TSX
;; being presumably equivalent to a 6502's JSR call.

;; This accounts for the difference between this statement and the version
;; on page 12: that is a pure interpreter, which can only call those host 
;; functions that are explicitly hard coded in.

;; This version knows how to recognise subroutines and jump to them, but I 
;; think that by implication at least this version can only work if it is
;; itself compiled with the Lisp compiler, since the section in curly braces
;; appears to be intended to be passed to the Lisp assembler.
