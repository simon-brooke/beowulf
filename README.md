# beowulf

LISP 1.5 is to all Lisp dialects as Beowulf is to Emglish literature.

## What this is

A work-in-progress towards an implementation of Lisp 1.5 in Clojure.

## BUT WHY?!!?!

Because.

Because Lisp is the only computer language worth learning, and if a thing is worth learning, it's worth learning properly; which means going back to the beginning and trying to understand that.

Because there is, so far as I know, no working implementation of Lisp 1.5 for modern machines.

Because I'm barking mad, and this is therapy.

[available online](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf).
