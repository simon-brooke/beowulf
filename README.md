# beowulf

LISP 1.5 is to all Lisp dialects as Beowulf is to Emglish literature.

## What this is

A work-in-progress towards an implementation of Lisp 1.5 in Clojure. The
objective is to build a complete and accurate implementation of Lisp 1.5
as described in the manual, with, in so far as is possible, exactly the
same bahaviour - except as documented below.

### Status

Boots to REPL, but few functions yet available.

* [Project website](https://simon-brooke.github.io/beowulf/).
* [Source code documentation](https://simon-brooke.github.io/beowulf/docs/codox/index.html).
* [Test Coverage Report](https://simon-brooke.github.io/beowulf/docs/cloverage/index.html)

### Architectural plan

Not everything documented in this section is yet built. It indicates the
direction of travel and intended destination, not the current state.

#### resources/lisp1.5.lsp

The objective is to have within `resources/lisp1.5.lsp`, all those functions
defined in the Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual which can be implemented in Lisp.

This means that, while Beowulf is hosted on Clojure, all that would be
required to rehost Lisp 1.5 on a different platform would be to reimplement

* bootstrap.clj
* host.clj
* read.clj

The objective this is to make it fairly easy to implement Lisp 1.5 on top of
any of the many [Make A Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal)
implementations.

#### beowulf/boostrap.clj

This file is essentially Lisp as defined in Chapter 1 (pages 1-14) of the
Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual; that is to say, a very simple Lisp language,
which should, I believe, be sufficient in conjunction with the functions
provided by `beowulf.host`, be sufficient to bootstrap the full Lisp 1.5
interpreter.

In addition it contains the function `INTEROP`, which allows host language
functions to be called from Lisp.

#### beowulf/host.clj

This file provides Lisp 1.5 functions which can't be (or can't efficiently
be) implemented in Lisp 1.5, which therefore need to be implemented in the
host language, in this case Clojure.

#### beowulf/read.clj

This file provides the reader required for boostrapping. It's not a bad
reader - it provides feedback on errors found in the input - but it isn't
the real Lisp reader.

Intended deviations from the behaviour of the real Lisp reader are as follows:

1. It reads the meta-expression language `MEXPR` in addition to the
    symbolic expression language `SEXPR`, which I do not believe the Lisp 1.5
    reader ever did;
2. It treats everything between a semi-colon and an end of line as a comment,
    as most modern Lisps do; but I do not believe Lisp 1.5 had this feature.


### BUT WHY?!!?!

Because.

Because Lisp is the only computer language worth learning, and if a thing
is worth learning, it's worth learning properly; which means going back to
the beginning and trying to understand that.

Because there is, so far as I know, no working implementation of Lisp 1.5
for modern machines.

Because I'm barking mad, and this is therapy.

### Commentary

What's surprised me in working on this is how much more polished Lisp 1.5 is
than legend had led me to believe. The language is remarkably close to
[Portable Standard Lisp](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/standard_lisp_family/#Portable_Standard_LISP_)
which is in my opinion one of the best and most usable early Lisp
implementations. I'm convinced you could still use Lisp 1.5 for interesting
and useful software (which isn't to say that some modern Lisps aren't better,
but this is software which is almost sixty years old).


## Installation

At present, clone the source and build it using

`lein uberjar`.

You will require to have [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) installed.

## Usage

`java -jar beowulf-0.1.0-standalone.jar`

This will start a Lisp 1.5 read/eval/print loop (REPL).

To end a session, type `quit` at the command prompt.

## Learning Lisp 1.5

The `Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual` is still
[in print, ISBN 13 978-0-262-13011-0](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/lisp-15-programmers-manual); but it's also
[available online](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf).

## Other Lisp 1.5 resources

The main resource I'm aware of is the Software Preservation Society's site,
[here](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/lisp1.5). It has lots
of fascinating stuff including full assembler listings for various obsolete
processors, but I failed to find the Lisp source of Lisp functions as a text
file, which is why `resources/lisp1.5.lsp` is largely copytyped and
reconstructed from the manual.

I'm not at this time aware of any other working Lisp 1.5 implementations.
